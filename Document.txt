Over summer, I (Christo Staszewski) Had an Internship for Crowe. During this, I worked on some problems and created solutions for the given projects they had me work on. 
After my internship was over, I went on vacation to the Badlands with some of my friends. 
There, while climbing a sheer face, I lost grip and smacked my face into the cliffside, resulting in a cut across the bottom of my chin. 
For the rest of the summer, I went back to work for the local furniture store “A Furniture and Bedding Showcase” here in Muncie.

This summer, I continued my internship with Ontario Systems and finally completed it at the beginning of August. Besides work, I began to garden more and grew a variety of peppers, my best batch being Ghost Peppers. I also got to visit Colorado for the first time and go camping which was a blast. I attempted to begin my own website making company too and am very hopeful to start reaching out to more local business.
