Over summer, I (Christo Staszewski) Had an Internship for Crowe. During this, I worked on some problems and created solutions for the given projects they had me work on. 
After my internship was over, I went on vacation to the Badlands with some of my friends. 
There, while climbing a sheer face, I lost grip and smacked my face into the cliffside, resulting in a cut across the bottom of my chin. 
For the rest of the summer, I went back to work for the local furniture store “A Furniture and Bedding Showcase” here in Muncie.

My name is Clay Reber, and I spent most of my summer working on my summer classes, and did my best to gain more experience with AWS.
My two classes were Web Development and PE, and I was lucky enought to get on the Dean's list.
I used my Ball State account to use LinkedIn Learning and study for the AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner Exam. 
Sadly, LinkedIn Learning was not as reliable of a resource as I thought. 
Planning on retaking the certification exam sometime this semester, if I have enough free time.
